Cross-compiled Scala 3 Dice Chess rules engine — the single source of truth for game rules across the dicechess ecosystem.

## Project context

- Public repository, AGPL-3.0 (see `LICENSE`); contributions require a CLA (`CLA.md`, part of an open-core strategy) — external contributors sign inside their first PR (`.github/cla-signatures.json`, enforced by the `CI: CLA` workflow).
- Ships three artifacts per release, all to GitHub Packages: Maven jar `lv.id.jc:dicechess-engine-scala_3` (JVM), npm `@rabestro/dicechess-engine` (Scala.js, from `dist/`), npm `@rabestro/dicechess-engine-wasm` (WebAssembly, from `dist-wasm/`).
- Published contracts consumed by dicechess-analytics, the play site, and bots:
  - The DFEN string format (FEN extended with a 7th field = remaining dice pool) — parser in `shared/src/main/scala/dicechess/engine/domain/FenParser.scala`, canonicalization in `movegen/Dfen.scala`.
  - Two exported JS objects: `DiceChess` (`js/src/main/scala/dicechess/engine/api/JsApi.scala`) and `EngineFacade` (`js/src/main/scala/dicechess/engine/EngineFacade.scala`), both typed by the hand-written `js/dicechess-engine.d.ts`.
  - `JvmApi` (`jvm/src/main/scala/dicechess/engine/jvmapi/JvmApi.scala`) — the facade non-Scala JVM callers (Java, Kotlin) bind to, consumed by dicechess-bot-java. Everything outside it is Scala-shaped surface such consumers cannot use without reflection or unchecked casts, so treat the facade as the contract and the rest as internal. Its Java-callability is pinned by a Java-source test (`jvm/src/test/java/`) — a Scala-only test cannot catch a signature that stops being reachable from Java.
- Changing any of these contracts is a cross-repo event — flag it in the PR description and treat as high blast radius.

## Architecture map

- `shared/src/main/scala/dicechess/engine/` — cross-compiled core (JVM + JS + Wasm):
  - `domain/` — opaque-type game state: `Bitboard`/`Square`/`Piece`/`Color` (`Models.scala`), `Position`, `GameFlags`, `Move`, `FenParser` (DFEN), `Symmetry`.
  - `movegen/` — `MagicBitboards`, `LeaperAttacks`, `PawnGeneration`, `MoveGenerator`, `LegalMovesFilter`, `Dfen`. Allocation-sensitive hot path.
  - `search/` — `TurnGenerator` (exhaustive micro-move paths), `Evaluator`, `BotRegistry` (six built-in bots + runtime `registerCustomBot`), `KingCaptureProbability` (216 dice outcomes), `MonteCarloEquity`/`MonteCarloSearch`, `ExpectimaxSearch`, `OpeningBook`(+`Bot`/`Parser`), `TimeManager`/`TimeBudgetedSearch`, `DrawOfferLogic`, ONNX feature extractors (`OnnxFeatures`, `RichFeatures`, `KcpFeatures`).
- `jvm/src/main/scala/dicechess/engine/` — entry point `Main.scala` (JLine REPL CLI, `cli/`), JVM-only ONNX inference bots (`search/OnnxEvalSearch.scala`, `OnnxExpectimaxSearch.scala` on onnxruntime), and `jvmapi/JvmApi.scala` — the Java/Kotlin-facing facade (the JVM row's counterpart to `js/`'s `EngineFacade`). ONNX bots are absent from the npm bundles.
- `arena/src/main/scala/dicechess/engine/bench/` — non-published sbt project (`arena`): six arena runners (`BotMatchRunner`, `TimedArenaRunner`, `OpeningBookArenaRunner`, `OnnxArenaRunner`, `OnnxExpectimaxArenaRunner`, `OnnxTimedArenaRunner`), SPRT/pentanomial machinery, and measurement probes.
- `js/` — Scala.js facade layer; `.wasm/` — the `rootWasm` project relinking the same sources to WebAssembly (ES2022 + WasmGC).
- `benchmark/` — JMH micro-benchmarks (excluded from coverage and publishing).
- `docs/` — Astro + Starlight documentation site (see Documentation below).
- There is no HTTP/WebSocket API, no database, and no effect system here — plain Scala 3 with opaque types; errors via `Either`.

## Commands

Prerequisites first:

```bash
mise install     # java temurin-25, node 26, lefthook, betterleaks, scalafmt (pinned), gh, jq
mise run setup   # brew install sbt universal-ctags tree + install git hooks
```

- Node is required even for plain `sbt 'testOnly *'` — JS/Wasm tests execute on Node. Missing/old Node fails the JS test run, not just docs.
- Consuming the published Maven/npm artifacts (in downstream repos) needs a `read:packages` GitHub token even though the packages are public. Inside this repo use `mise run publish:local` instead.

Daily tasks (defined in `mise.toml` + executable file tasks under `.mise/tasks/`):

```bash
mise run check          # THE pre-PR gate: scalafix check, clean, scalafmt check, coverage test + report
mise run test           # sbt testOnly * (JVM + JS + Wasm on Node)
mise run format         # sbt scalafmtAll; scalafixAll — git add new .scala files FIRST
mise run compile | run | console | coverage | clean
mise run bench | bench:quick | bench:filter <regex>     # JMH benchmarks
mise run arena [base] [games]                           # bot arena (BotMatchRunner)
mise run arena:timed | arena:book                       # time-controlled / opening-book arenas
mise run js:build | js:dev | wasm:build                 # bundles
mise run publish:local                                  # JVM jar to local Ivy for downstream dev
mise run docs:dev | docs:build                          # docs site (runs the doc generators first)
sbt doc                                                 # Scaladoc with COMPILED snippets — not in check
```

- ONNX arena runners have no mise task — run via `sbt "arena/runMain dicechess.engine.bench.OnnxArenaRunner <model.onnx> ..."`. Trained models are never committed (the tiny `synthetic_test_model.onnx` test fixtures are the deliberate exception).
- Releases are human-only: `gh workflow run release.yaml -f bump=patch|minor|major` (or local `mise run release:prepare`). Propose, never execute.

Common failure signatures:

- Pre-commit hook rejects a file that `mise run format` claims is already formatted → the file is untracked; `git add` it, format again.
- `sbt doc` errors inside a Scaladoc comment → a non-Scala example sits in a ```scala fence (see Gotchas).
- Second concurrent `sbt` invocation hangs/fails → sbt server socket collision; run sequential commands in one sbt session (#326).

## Quality gates — Definition of Done

- `mise run check` passes locally. It is stricter than PR CI: **PR CI (`ci.yaml`) does not run scalafix** — only `check` and the release/publish workflows do, so code can pass PR CI yet fail at release.
- Statement coverage >= 90% for `rootJVM`, >= 70% for `arena`, enforced by `build.sbt` (`coverageFailOnMinimum`). JVM-only; `benchmark/` and `.*Main\.scala` excluded.
- The compiler is a gate: `-Werror`, `-Wunused:all`, `-language:strictEquality`, `-Yexplicit-nulls` — any warning fails the build.
- CI also runs SonarCloud and Qodana scans; PR policy workflow enforces branch naming and issue links (see Git & PR workflow).
- Per-change-type extras:
  - Touched Scaladoc → run `sbt doc` locally (snippet compiler runs only in the docs-deploy CI, after merge).
  - Touched `movegen/` or `search/` hot paths → attach JMH evidence (`mise run bench:filter <pattern>`) to the PR.
  - Changed bot behavior/strength → attach an arena run (`mise run arena` or `arena:timed`).
  - Touched `.github/workflows/` → trigger the run manually with `gh workflow run ci.yaml`; such PRs have been observed not to trigger `pull_request` CI. `main` is not a protected branch — extra care.
  - Changed the JS API surface → update `js/dicechess-engine.d.ts` in the same PR.

## Code conventions

- Scala 3 "new" syntax enforced (scalafmt `convertToNewSyntax`, Scala3 dialect): braceless bodies with colons, extension methods, opaque types. `maxColumn` 120, 2-space indent, LF.
- Forbidden by scalafix `DisableSyntax`: `null`, `return`, `throw`. Errors via `Either` (e.g. `FenParser.parse`).
- `strictEquality` is on: derive `CanEqual` before using `==` on custom types. `-Yexplicit-nulls` is on: Java interop values are typed `| Null` and must be handled.
- Opaque types must document their bitwise memory layout in Scaladoc; companion objects carry the ops.
- Hot paths (`movegen/`, `search/`): bitwise ops on `Long`, `inline`/opaque zero-cost abstractions, avoid allocations in loops.
- Scaladoc: document *why*, not *what*; Markdown fences (never `{{{ }}}`); `[[Type]]` cross-references; strictly English.

## Testing conventions

- MUnit `FunSuite` + `munit-scalacheck` for properties. Suites named `*Suite`/`*Spec`; sentence-style test names; regression suites cite the issue number in the Scaladoc header.
- Two accepted ways to build positions: most suites use `FenParser.parse` + `.withDicePool(...)` directly; the JSON-fixture specs use the `ChessDsl` test DSL (`shared/src/test/scala/dicechess/engine/movegen/ChessDsl.scala`: `"<fen>".withDice(...)` builders taking a die or a tuple, `Move.toNotation`). Both patterns are fine.
- JSON fixture catalogs live in `shared/src/test/resources/movegen/` (`perft_suite.json`, `movegen_{1,2,3}_dice.json`) and `jvm/src/test/resources/search/king_capture_probabilities.json`. They double as docs-site content via the DocGenerators — changing them changes the published docs.
- Single suite: `sbt "rootJVM/testOnly dicechess.engine.search.TurnGeneratorSuite"` (JVM-only, fastest loop). Beware: a non-matching FQCN exits 0 with zero tests run — confirm the suite actually executed.
- Shared-code tests also run on the JS/Wasm Node runner, which is slower — avoid tight time budgets in tests or they will flake there (a MonteCarlo test already timed out once).
- No Docker is needed for any test in this repo.

## Gotchas

- Every ```` ```scala ```` fence in Scaladoc is **compiled** by `sbt doc` (`-snippet-compiler:compile`). Non-Scala examples (JSON, pseudocode) must use ```` ```text ````/```` ```json ```` fences — `mise run check` will not catch a bad fence, and it breaks the *next* docs deploy (see Documentation for why not necessarily yours).
- `git add` new `.scala` files **before** `mise run format`: `sbt scalafmtAll` skips untracked files, then the native-scalafmt pre-commit hook fails the commit.
- Do not "optimize" the `check` task order: `clean` runs before `scalafmtCheckAll` deliberately — sbt-scalafmt's warm cache can skip a misformatted file (#354).
- `publish.yaml` and `release.yaml` duplicate publish steps intentionally: tags created by `release.yaml` via `GITHUB_TOKEN` do not trigger `publish.yaml` (GitHub anti-recursion). Edit both in sync.
- `deploy-docs.yaml` hardcodes `target/out/jvm/scala-<version>/dicechess-engine-scala/api` for the Scaladoc merge — it goes stale on every Scala version bump; check it whenever `scalaVersion` changes.
- Turn maximality is measured in **dice consumed, not move count** — castling spends two dice in one move; the active color never changes within a turn. Regression suites: `TurnGeneratorSuite` (#347), `EnPassantMicroMoveSuite`.
- The engine does **not** support Chess960 castling — squares e1/h1/a1 are hardcoded.
- Root `package.json` version is dead weight — the real version comes from sbt at `package:prepare` time. Never "fix" or trust it.
- `BotRegistry` is a process-wide mutable singleton (`registerCustomBot`) — arena runners and the JS `registerOpeningBookBot` mutate global state; isolate tests that depend on registry contents.
- The pinned scalafmt version in `mise.toml` must exactly match `version` in `.scalafmt.conf` — the native pre-commit CLI does not auto-dispatch versions.
- Doc generators must run in ONE sbt session (`mise run docs:generate:all`); two parallel sbt boots collide on the server socket (#326).
- 🔑 **sbt 2's thin client reuses one server across workflow steps, and `sys.env` is frozen at server start.** A later step's `env:` is invisible to the build: the v1.11.4 release died with `401 Unauthorized` because `credentials` in `build.sbt` reads `sys.env`, and the server had been started by the validation step, before `GITHUB_TOKEN` existed. The same reuse carries the session's `set coverageEnabled := true` forward, so a publish with no forced recompile would ship coverage-instrumented bytecode. Any step that needs its own env or a clean session must run `sbt shutdown` first — `publish.yaml`/`release.yaml` do, then `clean`, then `rootJVM/assertNoCoverageInstrumentation` to prove the artifact is clean rather than assume it. Verify the mechanism with `sbt shutdown; FOO=bar sbt 'eval sys.env.get("FOO")'` versus the same without the shutdown.
- A broken workflow **does not fail CI** — it silently stops running, so its checks disappear rather than turn red, and `publish.yaml`/`release.yaml` are never exercised by a pull request at all. Invalid indentation reached `main` that way once (a step lost its `- name:` and its `run:` was out-dented). Both the pre-commit hook and `ci.yaml` now parse every `.github/workflows/*.y*ml` with Ruby's YAML. When editing a workflow: never use a multi-line regex (a trailing match silently swallows the rest of the file), and verify against the last **known-good** commit — not your own previous commit — that step names, order and counts are unchanged.
- Exclude `.claude/worktrees/` from repo-wide greps — a leftover worktree contains a full source copy and produces duplicate hits.
- sbt 2 rejects multiple CLI arguments and space-separated command lists (sbt 1 style) — every multi-step invocation must be ONE string joined with `;` (e.g. `sbt 'clean; coverage; testOnly *; coverageReport'`). This affects every `mise` task and CI workflow step that chains sbt commands.
- sbt 2's bare `test` key is defined as `testQuick`'s "skip if unchanged" semantics, not sbt 1's "run everything" — a warm build can silently report "0 tests, success". `testOnly *` always runs the full suite and is used everywhere `test` used to mean "run everything" (mise tasks, CI, publish/release workflows).
- `build.sbt`'s explicit root project (`dicechessEngineScala`) carries the whole `test`/`coverage` gate via `.aggregate(rootJVM, rootJS, rootWasm, benchmark)` — under sbt 1 nothing claimed `.` and sbt's own synthetic root aggregated every project for free, but `projectMatrix` rows live under `.sbt/matrix/<id>` so the list is now hand-maintained. **Omitting a project silently drops it from the gate instead of failing** (a missing `rootWasm` cost 408 Wasm tests with a green build). Add every new project here, and sanity-check `mise run test` still prints three totals: 527 JVM, 408 JS, 408 Wasm.
- sbt 2 defaults `Test / exportJars` to `true` (sbt 1 defaulted to `false`), packing test resources into a CAS-cached jar. `OnnxEvalSearchSpec`/`OnnxExpectimaxSearchSpec` resolve the bundled ONNX test model via `getClass.getResource(...).getPath`, which needs a real filesystem path — `build.sbt` sets `Test / exportJars := false` on `rootJVM` to keep it working.
- 🔑 **Coverage must run against a throwaway build cache** (#531). Coverage on Scala 3 is the compiler's own `-coverage-out:<dir>`, and the *compiler* is what creates that directory and writes the `scoverage.coverage` instrumentation metadata. sbt 2's global cache (`~/Library/Caches/sbt/v2`, `~/.cache/sbt/v2` on Linux) can serve `compile` outright — then the compiler never runs, nothing is instrumented, and `coverageReport` only *warns* "No coverage data, skipping reports", so `coverageFailOnMinimum` cannot fail and the 85% gate passes having measured nothing. It can instead surface as ~72 × `FileNotFoundException` on `scoverage.measurements.*` (presenting as `NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class …FenParser$`), taking down the whole JVM suite. **`clean` does not help — the cache lives outside `target/`.** Every coverage entry point (mise `coverage`/`check`, `ci.yaml`, `publish.yaml`, `release.yaml`) therefore runs `sbt shutdown` + `rm -rf target/covcache`, then `sbt -Dsbt.global.localcache="$PWD/target/covcache" '…; rootJVM/coverageDataCheck; coverageReport'`. All three parts matter: the property is read **only at server startup** (an already-running server silently ignores it and reuses the global cache), the `rm -rf` guarantees a cold start, and `coverageDataCheck` fails loudly if metadata is missing anyway. Carry all of it over to any new coverage path.
- Do **not** "simplify" the above to `set Global / cacheStores := Nil`. It is the obvious-looking fix and it does change the setting's value, but the cache is not read from it — verified ineffective, the compile is still served from cache. Project-scoped `cacheStores` does nothing either.
- Any build task whose job is to *detect* a bad state must be `Def.uncached`. sbt 2 caches task results, so `coverageDataCheck` without it replays its own earlier success and passes even once the metadata is gone — the very trap it guards against.
- `sbt -batch` talks to a **persistent server**, so a `set` from one invocation leaks into later ones: after any `sbt coverage ...`, `coverageEnabled` stays true for the whole session. Run `sbt shutdown` between runs when comparing behaviour, or conclusions about caching/coverage will be measuring leaked state rather than the build.

## Git & PR workflow
<!-- dc-shared:git-pr v2 — keep identical across dicechess repos -->
- Never commit to `main`. Branch: `<type>/<short-desc>` or `<type>/<id>-<short-desc>`
  (types: `task|feat|bug|refactor|chore|docs|ci|test|perf`). If the branch carries an issue
  id, the PR body must contain `Closes #<id>`.
- **The branch type chooses the release-notes section** — `.github/labeler.yml` turns it into a
  PR label and `.github/release.yml` groups by that label. `task/` is issue-driven work and counts
  as a feature, so a fix belongs on `bug/` even when it closes an issue; `chore/` is the grab-bag
  and files under "Other Changes". A type that maps to no label mis-files the whole PR: play-api
  v0.16.0 shipped ten features under 📚 Documentation because every branch was `task/` (which
  mapped to nothing) while every PR touched AGENTS.md (which mapped to `documentation`).
- Before editing anything: run `git status`. If the tree has unrelated uncommitted work,
  stop and report — never let it bleed into your commit.
- Stage specific files by name. `git add -A` / `git add .` are forbidden.
- Commits, PR descriptions, issues, and review replies are English-only. Commit subjects
  use conventional style: `feat: …`, `fix: …`, `docs: …`, `test: …`, `chore: …`.
- Before opening a PR: make the repo check task pass locally. Never pipe test output
  through `grep`/`head` — it masks exit codes.
- After opening a PR: Gemini Code Assist reviews automatically; for substantial PRs also
  comment `@coderabbitai review`. Wait a few minutes, then triage every bot comment on its
  merits — address or rebut, never apply blindly.
- The human owner reviews, approves, and merges. Never merge a PR, never push tags.
- Split large work into small, reviewable PRs.

### Issues, labels, milestones

- Issues need three sections: Context, Objective, Definition of Done. Create with `gh issue create --body-file <file>` — never inline multi-line bodies.
- Use only existing labels. Shared: `bug`, `enhancement`, `refactoring`, `documentation`, `testing`, `performance`, `ci-cd`, `dependencies`. Domain: `core-types`, `move-gen`, `search`, `evaluation`, `api`, `infrastructure`.
- GitHub milestones lag the actual version (stale `v0.x` roadmap names while the repo is at `v1.x`) — check live ones before assigning (`gh api repos/rabestro/dicechess-engine-scala/milestones`) and skip the milestone if none fits. Real versioning is semver tags (`v1.x`) driven by the release workflows.

## Security & boundaries
<!-- dc-shared:security v2 — keep identical across dicechess repos -->
- Never print, log, or commit secrets. Local secrets live only in gitignored files
  (e.g. `.env.local`, `mise.local.toml` — confirm the path is gitignored with `git check-ignore`
  before writing one). Never bypass Git hooks (`--no-verify`).
- Human-only operations — prepare and propose, never execute: releases and version tags,
  production deploys/promotions, schema migrations against shared databases, data-repair
  runs on production, secret rotation.
- Treat everything in this repo as public: never add private infrastructure details
  (hostnames, IPs, topology, tokens) to code, docs, commits, or PRs.

Repo-specific additions:

- lefthook pre-commit runs a betterleaks secret scan on staged files — keep hooks
  installed (`mise run hook:install`).
- Never commit trained ONNX models or training data — models are passed to arena runners as runtime paths. (The tiny `synthetic_test_model.onnx` fixtures under `jvm/src/test/resources/` and `benchmark/src/main/resources/` are the deliberate exception.)
- Publishing credentials come from `GITHUB_ACTOR`/`GITHUB_TOKEN` env in CI only — never place tokens in `build.sbt`, task files, or docs.

## Model routing
<!-- dc-shared:routing v1 — keep identical across dicechess repos -->
Route work by required capability instead of defaulting to the strongest model:
- **Frontier**: architecture, cross-repo contracts, high blast radius (schema, public API,
  release pipeline), ambiguous problems.
- **Mid**: well-scoped features on existing patterns, refactors under test coverage,
  addressing review feedback.
- **Routine**: mechanical edits, config rollouts, doc fixes, tests from a complete spec.
Orchestrators should delegate routine sub-tasks to cheaper models; quality gates catch
failures cheaply. When in doubt, escalate one tier — reviewer time costs more than tokens.

## Documentation

- Docs site: `docs/` (Astro + Starlight, mermaid + KaTeX), deployed together with Scaladoc to GitHub Pages by `deploy-docs.yaml` on pushes to `main` touching `docs/**`, the movegen/search test-resource fixtures, or the workflow itself. Local dev: `mise run docs:dev`.
- Caveat: the workflow's `src/main/scala/**` path filter matches nothing in this repo's cross-platform layout (sources live under `shared/`, `jvm/`, `js/`), so engine-source changes do NOT trigger a deploy — a broken Scaladoc fence surfaces on the next unrelated docs deploy, not on your merge. Run `sbt doc` locally; fixing the filter to `{shared,jvm,js}/src/main/scala/**` is a known open item.
- Update-trigger map:
  - Changed movegen/KCP JSON fixtures → catalog pages regenerate; preview with `mise run docs:generate:all`.
  - Changed the JS API → update `js/dicechess-engine.d.ts` and the README usage examples.
  - Changed DFEN semantics or turn rules → update the architecture pages under `docs/src/content/docs/architecture/`.
  - Touched Scaladoc → run `sbt doc` locally before pushing.
- Known-stale page: `docs/src/content/docs/guidelines/agent-workflows.md` understates the allowed branch types and the `check` task — this file (AGENTS.md) and `enforce-pr-policy.yaml` are authoritative.
- All documentation, comments, and commit text: English only.
