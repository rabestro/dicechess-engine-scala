title: Testing Strategy & DSL
description: How we ensure correctness of the move generator using human-readable Test DSL.
---

In a chess engine, the core logic (move generation, board representation) is performance-critical and heavily bitwise. Testing these components using raw hexadecimal masks or bit shifts is error-prone and difficult for humans to verify.

To solve this, we use a **Test Domain-Specific Language (DSL)** that allows us to write tests in plain chess notation or even visual ASCII boards.

## The Test DSL

Our testing utilities live in `src/test/scala/dicechess/engine/testutils/TestBoard.scala`. They provide three primary ways to interact with bitboards.

### 1. Visual ASCII Boards

For complex scenarios like **Magic Bitboards** (where blockers determine the range of sliding pieces), we can define the board state visually.

```scala
import dicechess.engine.testutils.TestBoard

val pos = TestBoard.fromAscii("""
  - - - - - - - -
  - - - - - - - -
  - - - - P - - -
  - - - - - - - -
  - - P - R - P -
  - - - - - - - -
  - - - - P - - -
  - - - - - - - -
""")

val occupancy = pos.occupied // Bitboard containing all 'P' and 'R' positions
```

The parser uses FEN-standard characters (`P`, `R`, `k`, etc.) and ignores whitespace, dots, and dashes.

### 2. Algebraic Varargs

When you just need to place a few pieces or verify specific targets, you can use the varargs constructor:

```scala
// Creates a bitboard with bits set at d3 and f5
val occupancy = TestBoard("d3", "f5")
```

### 3. Extension Methods

For maximum brevity, we provide extension methods on standard `String` literals:

```scala
import dicechess.engine.testutils.TestBoard.*

val sq = "e4".sq  // Returns a Square object
val bb = "e4".bb  // Returns a Bitboard with e4 set
```

## Example: Testing a Rook Attack

Here is how a real test looks using the DSL:

```scala
test("Rook attacks with blockers") {
  val sq = "e4".sq
  
  val pos = TestBoard.fromAscii("""
    - - - - - - - -
    - - - - - - - -
    - - - - P - - -
    - - - - - - - -
    - - P - R - P -
    - - - - - - - -
    - - - - P - - -
    - - - - - - - -
  """)
  
  val attacks = MagicBitboards.rookAttacks(sq, pos.occupied)
  
  val expected = TestBoard(
    "e5", "e6", // North
    "e3", "e2", // South
    "d4", "c4", // West
    "f4", "g4"  // East
  )
  
  assertEquals(attacks, expected)
}
```

## Dice Chess Move Generator Testing

For complex, multi-move path-optimization rules under Dice Chess mechanics, standard unit tests can quickly become verbose and difficult for humans to review. To solve this, we use a structured **JSON-based testing framework** paired with an **automatic visual catalog compiler** that bridges the gap between bitwise engine logic and human verification.

### 1. JSON Test Suites

All move generator test cases are structured in JSON files under `shared/src/test/resources/movegen/` and categorized by the number of dice rolled:
* `movegen_1_dice.json` — 1-die fundamental leaper/slider moves.
* `movegen_2_dice.json` — 2-dice micro-move sequences.
* `movegen_3_dice.json` — 3-dice full turn path optimizations.

Each test case is expert-vetted and contains:
* `fen`: The board position in standard FEN notation.
* `dice`: An array of rolled dice values (1 = Pawn, 2 = Knight, 3 = Bishop, 4 = Rook, 5 = Queen, 6 = King).
* `expectedMoves`: A list of all legal UCI move sequences (e.g., `"e2e4"`, `"g1f3"`).
* `title`: A short, descriptive scenario title.
* `description`: A clear explanation of the expected chess mechanics.

Example JSON entry:
```json
{
  "fen": "rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3pP3/2B5/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq d6 0 1",
  "dice": [1],
  "expectedMoves": ["e5e6", "e5d6", "c2c3", "d2d3", "d2d4", "h2h4"],
  "title": "En Passant and Path Blockage",
  "description": "A complex pawn scenario: the pawn on e5 can capture the black d5 pawn en passant (exd6). The c2 pawn's two-square advance is blocked..."
}
```

### 2. The Movegen Test DSL

To keep our test files clean and type-safe, we extended our fluent DSL in `shared/src/test/scala/dicechess/engine/movegen/ChessDsl.scala`. This allows developers to dynamically construct and verify test cases using simple, readable extension methods:

```scala
import dicechess.engine.movegen.ChessDsl.*
import dicechess.engine.domain.PieceType.*

val testCase = "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1"
  .withDice(Pawn)
  .titled("Initial position: pawn moves")
  .describedAs("Standard starting position...")
  .shouldYield("a2a3", "a2a4", "b2b3", "b2b4")
```

### 3. Automated MUnit Integration

MUnit dynamically parses these JSON files and registers each entry as an isolated test case. The test runner uses the custom titles and descriptions from the JSON entries to name and document tests inside the console outputs, providing extremely readable test logs:

```bash
==> i dicechess.engine.movegen.MoveGenJsonSpec.1-Die Scenarios: En Passant and Path Blockage (A complex pawn scenario...) | Dice: [1]
```

### 4. Dynamic Visual Documentation Pipeline

To make these test cases easy to audit by chess players and domain experts, we build a **live visual test catalog** directly inside our documentation portal. 

When you run:
```bash
mise run docs:build
```

The build task executes our documentation compiler `DocGenerator.scala` which:
1. **Parses the JSON suites**: Reads all active test cases from sbt resources.
2. **Extracts FEN Metadata**: Dynamically parses each FEN string to display Active Color, Castling Rights, and En Passant targets.
3. **Flips the Board**: Generates a dynamic graphical chess board using Lichess GIF exports, automatically setting `color=black` for black-active positions so they render from the player's perspective.
4. **Applies Responsive HTML Grid**: Wraps each scenario in a premium two-column CSS grid that automatically adapts to mobile screens.
5. **Compiles the Astro Site**: Automatically updates `/architecture/move-generation/06-test-cases/` on the docs site.

## Why this matters

1. **Self-Documenting**: The tests show exactly what is being tested without requiring comments.
2. **Fast Debugging**: If a test fails, the diff between two `Bitboard` objects is rendered by MUnit, and you can easily cross-reference it with the visual board in the test code.
3. **Correctness**: It is much harder to make a mistake when typing `"e4"` than when typing `1L << 28`.
