title: Search Roadmap & Evaluation
description: The staged plan for improving Dice Chess search and the benchmark protocol used to validate each upgrade.

  order: 3
---

The engine currently has a complete 6-level single-turn (primitive) bot roster: `RandomSearch`, `CheckmateAwareSearch`, `GreedySearch` (baseline), `GreedySearchV2` (Cautious Greedy), `AggressiveSearch`, and `PrudentSearch`.

This forms a solid baseline for move evaluation, but single-turn bots are limited to a 1-turn horizon. To develop a stronger, grandmaster-level engine, we need to transition from single-turn heuristics to a deep, probabilistic search tree.

This document defines:
1. the revised implementation roadmap for deep search algorithms and optimizations
2. the evaluation protocol that every new search algorithm must pass before it replaces the baseline

## Goals

The search roadmap should improve move quality without losing the properties that already matter:

* legal move selection under the maximum micro-moves rule
* deterministic and reproducible testing
* predictable runtime for browser and JVM usage
* a clear migration path from simple heuristics to probabilistic tree search

Future changes should therefore be judged on two axes:

* **playing strength** against the current baseline (`GreedySearch` or the latest optimized bot)
* **cost** in runtime, implementation complexity, and memory footprint (minimizing garbage collection on the hot path)

## Baseline

The current baseline is `GreedySearch` (Level 3).

While primitive, it has several advantages:
* it reasons over the full Dice Chess turn, not a single micro-move
* it is deterministic
* it is easy to explain and debug
* it creates a stable reference point for head-to-head testing

The baseline remains available even after stronger algorithms are added. It serves as the control group for all future experiments.

## Revised Roadmap

The search roadmap is divided into progressive optimization and tree-search stages.

### Stage 1: Prudent Bot Optimization (High Priority)

The probabilistically reply-aware `PrudentSearch` (Level 6) demonstrates excellent playing strength (**72.3%** win rate against Greedy) but suffers from a severe execution bottleneck (**~13 hours** to complete a 1,600-game match). 

Planned improvements:
* **transposition caching** during the DFS evaluation of the 216 dice rolls
* **pruning** paths where the king is already proven safe or captured, skipping redundant evaluations
* **avoiding garbage collection (GC) allocations** in `KingCaptureProbability` search loops by reusing state objects or bitwise representations

The goal is to reduce Prudent's execution time from ~30s per move to under 50ms, making it usable in real-time matches.

**Milestone fit**:
* belongs to **v0.5 - Evaluation & Heuristics** performance phase.

### Stage 2: Deep Expectimax Search

This stage introduces depth-first traversal of multiple plies (turns), reasoning about future turns.

Expected characteristics:
* **Chance Nodes:** Representing the stochastic dice roll outcomes (216 ordered rolls / 56 unique multisets) of both sides.
* **Decision Nodes:** Selecting the optimal full-turn path (1-3 micro-moves) for the active player.
* **Bounded Depth:** Dynamically adjusted search depth based on remaining time controls.

**Milestone fit**:
* primarily **v0.6 - Expectimax Search Engine**

### Stage 3: Search Optimizations (Star1 & Star2 Pruning)

Traversing a deep expectimax tree scales exponentially. We must implement advanced alpha-beta pruning extensions for games with chance nodes:
* **Star1/Star2 Pruning:** Prunes chance nodes by calculating bounds on the mathematical expectation and skipping subtrees that cannot affect the optimal choice.
* **Zobrist Hashing & Transposition Tables (TT):** Caches previously computed node values, bounds, and search depths. Zobrist keys must include the board position, active color, and remaining dice pool.

**Milestone fit**:
* primarily **v0.6 - Expectimax Search Engine** and **v0.5** (Zobrist/TT groundwork)

### Stage 4: Parallel Search with Ox Concurrency

To utilize multi-core server processors (such as the 4-core ARM nodes on Oracle Cloud), we will parallelize the evaluation of chance-node subtrees:
* Use **Java Virtual Threads** (via the `Ox` structured concurrency library) to spawn lightweight concurrent branch evaluations.
* Ensure thread-safe read operations on transposition tables.
* Implement structured cancellation to stop running threads immediately when a beta-cutoff is triggered or when search time expires.

**Milestone fit**:
* primarily **v0.6 - Expectimax Search Engine**

### Stage 5: Monte-Carlo Pre-Roll Equity

Parallel to the exact tree search, a Rao-Blackwellized Monte-Carlo estimator gives an *on-demand*
pre-roll win-probability estimate for positions too sparse in the games database to read empirically.
It integrates the exact per-ply king-capture probability (`KingCaptureProbability`) along a random
rollout weighted by survival, which cuts variance sharply versus vanilla 0/1 rollouts. It reuses
`TurnGenerator` + the `RandomSearch` policy and exposes a configurable budget (rollouts / target CI
width / ply horizon).

See [Monte-Carlo Pre-Roll Equity](/architecture/search/04-monte-carlo-equity/) for the algorithm,
the variance rationale, and budgeting. It complements position canonicalization (which pools
empirical statistics across symmetric positions) for genuinely off-book positions, and shares the
`KingCaptureProbability` machinery with the expectimax chance-node evaluation.

**Milestone fit**:
* feeds the analytics equity guidance now; aligns with **v0.6 - Expectimax Search Engine** machinery.

## Evaluation Pyramid

Every new algorithm or optimization must be validated at three levels.

### Level 1: Unit Correctness

These tests prove that the algorithm respects core game semantics and obvious tactical priorities.
* immediate king capture is always preferred over any non-terminal material sequence
* the maximum micro-moves rule is never violated
* castling still consumes the correct dice and is scored correctly
* promotion branches are ranked consistently

This level protects correctness and prevents regressions that would otherwise be hidden inside large simulations.

### Level 2: Scenario Suite

This suite is a curated set of fixed positions designed to stress the evaluator and shallow search logic.
* immediate king capture
* unblock-and-capture
* promotion race
* king exposure after material gain
* sacrificial trap
* high-mobility versus low-mobility positions
* symmetric positions used to verify deterministic tie-breaking

Each scenario defines the FEN, dice multiset, expected preferred line, and the rationale. This suite must remain small enough to run in every local `mise run check`.

### Level 3: Mass Simulation (Bot Arena)

This is the acceptance layer for comparing playing strength. Each challenger algorithm plays a large head-to-head match against the baseline:
* baseline as White, challenger as Black
* challenger as White, baseline as Black
* fixed seed lists for reproducibility
* repeated across multiple starting positions, tactical middlegames, and simplified endgames

---

## Match Protocol

The benchmark harness should follow a stable protocol so that results remain comparable over time.

### Required controls
* deterministic PRNG seeding
* explicit algorithm identity and Git commit hash in output reports
* symmetric color assignment (equal games as White and Black)
* turn/time budget settings recorded in the report
* fixed resignation, repetition, and 50-move limit rules

### Required metrics
At minimum, collect:
* win, loss, and draw rates
* average game length (turns)
* average decision time per turn
* average number of candidate paths or nodes evaluated
* runtime distribution (percentiles), not just mean runtime

### Acceptance criteria
A challenger should replace the baseline only when all of the following are true:
* it passes unit correctness and scenario-suite checks
* it shows a statistically meaningful improvement in head-to-head results (Win Rate > 50%)
* it does not introduce an unacceptable runtime regression for the target environment (e.g. browser/JS vs server/JVM)

## Reporting Format

Each experiment should produce a concise report:
```text
================================================================================
🎲♟️  Dice Chess Bot Arena - JVM Match Runner
Baseline Bot: [Name] (ID)
Games per Color: [N] (Total [2N] games per match)
================================================================================
Opponent Bot    | Total | Wins (W/B)   | Losses (W/B) | Draws (W/B)  | Win Rate | Time    
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Bot A]         | 1600  | ...          | ...          | ...          |    ...%  | ...s
```

This makes search changes reviewable inside pull requests instead of relying on anecdotal observations.

## Suggested Issue Decomposition

The future search engine tasks are decomposed as follows:

1. `Performance: Optimize PrudentSearch and KingCaptureProbability` (caching, DFS pruning)
2. `Expectimax search skeleton` (Milestone v0.6)
3. `Star1 and Star2 pruning implementation`
4. `Zobrist Hashing & Transposition Table integration`
5. `Structured concurrency: parallelize chance-nodes using Ox`
6. `Search evaluation reports and fixtures`

## Milestone Mapping

The recommended milestone mapping is:

* **v0.5 - Evaluation & Heuristics**
  * `PrudentSearch` performance optimization
  * Zobrist Hashing implementation
  * Transposition Table structure
* **v0.6 - Expectimax Search Engine**
  * Expectimax implementation and chance-node evaluations
  * Star1/Star2 pruning
  * Concurrency and parallel search improvements with `Ox`

This keeps the project aligned with the approved milestones published in [[AGENTS.md]](file:///Users/jcemisovs/Repositories/dicechess-engine-scala/AGENTS.md).
