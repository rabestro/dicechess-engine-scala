/** Duels one model against itself at two different `candidateLimit` values, under a clock.
  *
  * The gap this fills: every other timed runner resolves its opponent through [[BotRegistry]] by id, so it can only
  * play an ONNX bot against a *built-in* bot. The question that matters for the pre-rank seam (`dicechess-ev#14`) is
  * narrower than that — hold the model fixed and vary only how many root candidates the search is allowed to expand.
  * Nothing could ask it in-process before this.
  *
  * Why it is worth asking. A probe over 300 corpus positions found that the material cut at `K=24` changes the search's
  * decision in 64% of positions with more than 24 legal turns, and that the hidden turns are usually better by
  * loss-taint margins — the narrow search's best candidate loses the king on some rolls where the wide one does not.
  * Yet the untimed K-curve flattened past 24. Both can only be true if the value never converts to wins, or if the
  * K-curve was measured too coarsely to see it (n=100 per cell resolves about ±10pp). This runner settles it by
  * changing one variable and nothing else — and it needs no trained ranker, so a null here closes `dicechess-ev#14`
  * before any training data is generated.
  *
  * Timed on purpose, unlike the probe. Width costs time: a wider search that finds a better move but arrives late is
  * not an improvement. That trade-off only exists under a clock, and it is hardware-dependent — the same comparison has
  * measured +28 elo on fast cores against +82 on an Ampere A1 — so the machine is part of the experiment, not a detail
  * of it.
  *
  * Reports through [[BotMatchRunner.runTimedMatch]], so a `--json` run carries the mirrored-pair histogram and the
  * `resolution` block (#508): what difference the run could actually have resolved, rather than only a win rate.
  *
  * Usage:
  * `sbt 'arena/runMain dicechess.engine.bench.OnnxWidthDuelRunner <model.onnx> --wide-k 48 --narrow-k 24 --features rich --games 10 --presets 3+2'`
