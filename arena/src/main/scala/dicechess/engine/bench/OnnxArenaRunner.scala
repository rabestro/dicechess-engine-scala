/** Local arena between an externally-trained (LightGBM, via ONNX) one-ply evaluator and a built-in bot — the
  * acceptance-gate check for the Dice Chess AI hackathon project (>= 55% win rate over enough games to be a real
  * signal).
  *
  * The built-in bot is passed to [[BotMatchRunner.runArena]] as the BASELINE and the ONNX bot as the opponent, because
  * the summary table reports each opponent's wins against the baseline — this way the printed row is the MODEL's
  * win/loss/win-rate, which is the number the gate is about (same orientation as [[OpeningBookArenaRunner]]).
  *
  * The ONNX model file is read from a path at runtime, so it never has to be committed to this public repository — keep
  * it outside version control (it lives in a private repository's `models/` directory, not published alongside this
  * codebase).
  *
  * Usage: `sbt 'arena/runMain dicechess.engine.bench.OnnxArenaRunner <model.onnx> --opponent <base> --games <N>'`
