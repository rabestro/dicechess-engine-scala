/** Board-symmetry transforms and position canonicalization for Dice Chess.
  *
  * Two positions related by a rules-preserving symmetry have identical win probability, so collapsing them to a single
  * canonical representative lets downstream consumers pool statistics (analytics) and share results across equivalent
  * positions (search transposition tables, Monte-Carlo caches).
  *
  * This object provides two exact symmetries: **color-flip** (always legal) and **horizontal mirror** (a
  * win-probability symmetry only when there are no castling rights — see below). Horizontal *shift* is intentionally
  * excluded: translation is not an isometry of the bounded 8x8 board (it changes a piece's distance to the edge, and
  * therefore its mobility), so it does **not** preserve win probability.
  *
  * ## Color-flip
  *
  * A vertical board mirror (rank `r` <-> rank `9 - r`) combined with swapping every piece's colour and the side to
  * move. Because Black's downward pawns become White's upward pawns, the result is a strategically identical position
  * with the side to move relabelled (white-to-move <-> black-to-move). It is an **involution**:
  * `colorFlip(colorFlip(s)) == s`.
