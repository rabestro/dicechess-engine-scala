/** Capability mix-in for a [[SearchAlgorithm]] that can search under a wall-clock deadline.
  *
  * A plain [[SearchAlgorithm]] runs to its own internal budget (a fixed rollout or node count); a `TimeBudgetedSearch`
  * additionally accepts an external [[java.lang.System.nanoTime]] deadline and is expected to stop at it, always
  * returning a legal fallback move when one exists. This lets a caller on a game clock (e.g. the JS API's
  * `timeBudgetMs`) bound per-move thinking time without knowing the algorithm's internals.
  *
  * The deadline path is non-deterministic by design (it depends on machine speed), so it is meant for play rather than
  * reproducible tests.
  *
  * ## Granularity is part of the contract
  *
  * A search can only stop where it yields, so "stops at the deadline" is really "stops at the first yield point after
  * it". An implementation must therefore keep its unit of uninterruptible work **well below a realistic per-move
  * budget**, or the contract holds only on paper. [[ExpectimaxSearch]] learned this the expensive way: it once checked
  * the clock between root candidates only, and a single candidate at `candidateLimit=24` on one core measured a 6.5 s
  * median against a 1.9 s allocation — a 3.4x overshoot the caller had no way to prevent (#496). Prefer a yield point
  * whose cost is a small fraction of the whole search, and guard the clock read so the untimed path pays nothing.
