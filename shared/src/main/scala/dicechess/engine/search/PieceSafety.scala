/** Boolean piece-safety primitives: which pieces stand *en prise* (attacked and undefended).
  *
  * This is the building block behind the hang telemetry in the arena ([[dicechess.engine.bench.BotMatchRunner]]) and is
  * deliberately shared so a safety-aware pre-ranker or feature extractor can later reuse the exact same notion of
  * "hanging" — a metric and the signal it motivates must agree on definitions, or the metric can't validate the fix.
  *
  * The definition is the *deterministic-chess* one, kept intentionally simple:
  *   - attack and defense are boolean ([[MoveGenerator.isSquareAttacked]]), with no exchange evaluation — a piece
  *     defended once but attacked twice does not count as hanging;
  *   - a king "defends" its neighbours like any other piece, even when recapturing would be suicidal against a defended
  *     attacker;
  *   - en passant is not modeled (the capture lands on a square the victim does not occupy);
  *   - kings are never "hanging" — an attacked king is check, a different concept with its own machinery
  *     ([[Evaluator.evaluateKingSafety]], [[KingCaptureProbability]]).
  *
  * Dice probabilities are also deliberately absent: whether the opponent can *roll* the attacker's die is a separate,
  * composable concern (the chance of punishing a hang is `1 - ((6 - k) / 6)^3` for `k` distinct attacking piece types),
  * and keeping this primitive dice-free lets one implementation serve both a raw blunder count and a dice-weighted risk
  * feature.
