/** The opening-book key contract shared between the engine (the consumer, via [[OpeningBookBot]]) and the analytics
  * exporter (the producer, `dicechess-analytics`).
  *
  * A key identifies a *position together with its dice roll* and is built as:
  * ```text
  * <piece-placement> <active-color> <castling> <en-passant> <dice>
  * ```
  *
  *   - The first four fields are the FEN fields exactly as produced by [[FenParser.serialize]] — byte-for-byte the
  *     analytics `normalized_fen`. The half-move and full-move clocks are deliberately **omitted**: an opening book is
  *     independent of the move counters, and dropping them lets concrete positions that differ only by clock share a
  *     single book entry.
  *   - `<dice>` is the rolled piece letters (`p n b r q k`), sorted ascending and cased by the side to move —
  *     upper-case for White, lower-case for Black. This is identical to the analytics `dice_sorted` column. Example for
  *     White rolling bishop + pawn + rook: `BPR`.
  *
  * The value mapped to a key is the chosen continuation as a comma-separated list of long-algebraic micro-moves (e.g.
  * `"e2e4,f1c4"`, with a promotion suffix such as `"e7e8q"` where applicable). [[OpeningBookBot]] matches it against
  * the legal turn paths by move multiset, so the stored order is not significant.
  *
  * Example key: `rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - BPR`
  *
  * Any change to this format is a cross-repository breaking change and must be mirrored in the analytics exporter and
  * its round-trip test.
