/** The raw board as 12 binary planes of 64 squares — no hand-crafted features at all.
  *
  * This is the input contract of the private training pipeline's raw-board value net, whose premise is that a small MLP
  * over the bare board has capacity a 9-feature GBDT lacks. Where [[OnnxFeatures]] / [[RichFeatures]] / [[KcpFeatures]]
  * hand the model a summary of the position, this hands it the position.
  *
  * Layout, which the Python side (`board.py::encode_fen`) must match bit for bit:
  *   - planes `0..5` are the '''mover's''' Pawn, Knight, Bishop, Rook, Queen, King, in [[PieceType]] order;
  *   - planes `6..11` are the opponent's, same order;
  *   - within a plane the index is the [[Square]] index seen from the mover (`0` = the mover's own a1 corner), so for
  *     Black the ranks are mirrored (`rank 1 <-> rank 8`) while files are left alone;
  *   - a square holding a piece is `1.0f`, everything else `0.0f`.
  *
  * Both halves of that convention — own-pieces-first and rank mirroring — make the encoding mover-canonical: side to
  * move stops being an input dimension, exactly as the `own minus opponent` convention does for the material features.
  * The starting array is symmetric under this transform, so both colors encode it identically.
  *
  * Unlike [[RichFeatures]] this needs '''no move generation'''. That does '''not''' make it cheaper, which is worth
  * stating plainly because the opposite was assumed when this was written: extraction gets cheaper, but the model
  * behind it does not. Measured on the one-ply arena over the same 400/1600-game harness, a raw-board net costs ~0.195
  * s/game against ~0.0375 s/game for a rich(9) GBDT — '''~5x more per evaluation''', because a 768-wide input through a
  * 256x32 MLP outweighs the two `generateAllMoves` passes it saves. A 2-ply run at `candidateLimit = 24` corroborates
  * it: rich finishes 400 games in ~25 minutes, this did not finish in two hours.
  *
  * So the reason to use this set is '''strength per evaluation''', not throughput: at one ply it scores 57.3% against
  * the `aggressive` baseline where rich(9) scores 48.0%, while costing 1/253 of the `kcp` teacher's 60.8%. Anything
  * that budgets leaf evaluations — a deeper search, or a bot under a clock — has to weigh that 5x.
  *
  * @note
  *   Dice-free by construction, like every other feature set here: it scores an afterstate whose next roll is unknown.
