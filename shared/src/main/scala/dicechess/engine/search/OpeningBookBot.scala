/** A decorator that consults an opening book before falling back to the wrapped algorithm.
  *
  * The `book` maps a canonical key (see [[OpeningBook.key]]) to the chosen continuation, a comma-separated list of
  * long-algebraic micro-moves (e.g. `"e2e4,f1c4"`). When the current position's key is present, the decorator plays the
  * booked turn instantly — without spending the underlying bot's search budget — which is exactly where a heuristic or
  * rollout-based engine is weakest and where empirical data is richest. Otherwise it delegates to `underlying`.
  *
  * The booked moves are matched against the position's legal turn paths by move **multiset**, so the order stored in
  * the book does not matter and an entry that cannot be realised legally (a stale or corrupt book) is silently ignored
  * in favour of the underlying bot rather than played illegally.
  *
  * Construct via [[OpeningBookBot.decorate]], which preserves the underlying bot's time-budget capability: wrapping a
  * [[TimeBudgetedSearch]] yields a [[TimeBudgetedOpeningBookBot]] (the deadline reaches the underlying), while wrapping
  * a plain bot yields a plain decorator — so a host's `getBestMove` does not advertise a time budget for a bot that
  * ignores it.
  *
  * @param underlying
  *   the bot to consult when the position is not booked
  * @param book
  *   the opening book, keyed per [[OpeningBook.key]]
