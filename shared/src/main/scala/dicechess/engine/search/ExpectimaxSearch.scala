/** Two-ply expectimax search for Dice Chess: my turn, then the opponent's dice roll, then the opponent's best reply.
  *
  * Unlike a one-ply evaluator ([[GreedySearch]], [[OnnxEvalSearch]]), this looks one full turn ahead and so sees
  * tactical punishments — a capture that hangs a bigger piece to the recapture — that a static evaluation cannot. The
  * layer between the two plies is a **chance node**: the opponent's roll is unknown when we move, so the value of our
  * turn is the expectation over all [[DiceRolls]] outcomes of the opponent's best (for them) reply.
  *
  * The evaluation function is injected as a batch (`evalBatch(states, color)` scores every state from `color`'s
  * perspective) so the same search works with any leaf evaluator — the engine's material score, or an externally
  * trained model — and so the many leaves under one chance node can be scored in a single call. Leaf scores are only
  * ever compared, minimised, and averaged, so the search is agnostic to the evaluator's absolute scale.
  *
  * Two terminal cases sit outside the evaluator, because a king capture ends the game and material scores never see the
  * king:
  *   - if one of our own turns captures the opponent's king, we play it immediately (an outright win);
  *   - a leaf where the opponent captures our king is worth [[ExpectimaxSearch.LossValue]] — below any real score on
  *     any scale — so the opponent always takes it and we always rank that line last.
  *
  * Depth is fixed at two plies. As a [[TimeBudgetedSearch]] it also honours a wall-clock deadline, expanding pre-ranked
  * candidates until time runs out.
  *
  * @param preRank
  *   batched evaluator used to rank the mover's own legal turns before the (expensive) chance-node expansion — only the
  *   top [[ExpectimaxConfig.candidateLimit]] are explored. Defaults to material ([[ExpectimaxSearch.materialBatch]] —
  *   the historical, hardcoded behaviour). Widening `candidateLimit` compensates for a crude pre-ranker at linear
  *   search-cost growth; a sharper pre-ranker (e.g. the same value model already driving the chance node) attacks the
  *   actual bottleneck instead — candidateLimit=16 vs material pre-ranking measured +4.8pp purely from surfacing turns
  *   the material proxy had buried outside the top 8.
  * @param statsSink
  *   receives one [[RootSearchStats]] per `findBestMove` call. Defaults to a no-op so the hot path pays nothing beyond
  *   a single call; a real sink lets a host (arena runner, production bot) observe how many candidates the deadline
  *   actually allowed — see [[RootSearchStats]] for why that matters.
