/** Result of a Monte-Carlo pre-roll equity estimate.
  *
  * The three probabilities partition every rollout's outcome mass and therefore sum to `1.0`:
  *   - [[whiteWin]] / [[blackWin]] — probability that White / Black captures a king first;
  *   - [[undecided]] — residual survival mass at the ply horizon (games that were neither won nor lost within
  *     `maxPlies`).
  *
  * @param standardError
  *   the standard error of the [[whiteWin]] estimate (`sqrt(sampleVariance / rollouts)`); halve by quadrupling
  *   rollouts.
  * @param varianceReductionVsVanilla
  *   how many times smaller the per-rollout variance is than a vanilla 0/1 Monte-Carlo with the same mean would be
  *   (`mean·(1-mean) / sampleVariance`). Values `> 1` quantify the Rao-Blackwell gain; `+Infinity` means the estimate
  *   is exact (zero sample variance, e.g. a position decided on the first roll).

/** Rao-Blackwellized Monte-Carlo pre-roll equity estimator.
  *
  * For a position with too few games in the database to read an empirical win-rate, this estimates
  * `P(White win) / P(Black win) / P(undecided)` on demand. It is the Scala port of the C++ reference
  * ([[https://github.com/rabestro/dice-chess-engine]]).
  *
  * ## Algorithm
  *
  * Each rollout walks a random game and, at every ply, integrates the **exact** per-ply king-capture probability
  * `p = wins / 216` from [[KingCaptureProbability]] instead of sampling a 0/1 win:
  *
  * ```text
  * survive = 1
  * for each ply (side S to move):
  *   p = P(S captures the opponent king on this roll)   // exact, over all 216 rolls
  *   winsOf(S) += survive * p
  *   survive   *= (1 - p)
  *   advance to a random surviving continuation          // a sampled non-capturing turn
  * ```
  *
  * Because the win mass at each node is added analytically (Rao-Blackwellization) rather than as a Bernoulli sample,
  * the estimator has far lower variance than vanilla 0/1 Monte-Carlo — [[EquityEstimate.varianceReductionVsVanilla]]
  * reports the measured ratio.
  *
  * ## Deviation from the reference
  *
  * The reference advances the rollout to *any* sampled legal turn, including king-captures. A king capture is terminal,
  * so following it produces a king-less board that is then (incorrectly) played on, a small second-order bias. As the
  * rules source of truth this estimator instead conditions the continuation on survival: it advances only through turns
  * that do **not** capture a king (the event with probability `1 - p` that `survive` already tracks). The analytic
  * per-ply terms — and therefore the variance self-check — are unaffected.
