/** Mix-in that equips a [[SearchAlgorithm]] with draw-awareness based on insufficient material and evaluation
  * thresholds.
  *
  * Bots mixing in this trait will offer a draw when neither side can force a king capture — the win condition in Dice
  * Chess. This happens with king + at most one bishop each, no other pieces, kings safely separated and the defending
  * king on the opposite square colour from the enemy bishop. They will accept a draw offer when the position evaluation
  * drops below −200 centipawns (down material).
  *
  * The trait is designed to be reusable — any `SearchAlgorithm` can gain draw logic simply by declaring:
  * ```text
  * object MyBot extends SearchAlgorithm with DrawOfferLogic
  * ```
  *
  * ## Why separate from `SearchAlgorithm`
  *
  * The base [[SearchAlgorithm]] defaults both draw methods to `false` so that simple bots remain silent. This trait
  * packages a single, consistent draw policy that can be composed with any strategy without code duplication.

trait DrawOfferLogic extends SearchAlgorithm:

  /** Offers a draw when the position is a theoretical dead draw: neither player can ever force a king capture — the win
    * condition in Dice Chess.
    *
    * The check requires all of the following:
    *   - No pawns, knights, rooks, or queens on the board.
    *   - Each side has at most one bishop.
    *   - The two kings are not on adjacent squares.
    *   - For every bishop on the board, the opposing king stands on a square of the opposite colour — making a diagonal
    *     attack impossible in either direction.
    *
    * These constraints capture the standard "insufficient material" cases:
    *   - `K vs K`
    *   - `K+B vs K` (defending king on correct colour)
    *   - `K+B vs K+B` (one bishop each, both kings safe)
