/** The material feature set ([[OnnxFeatures]]) plus cheap, dice-free positional features — the signal a material-only
  * model is blind to (it cannot tell two positions of equal material apart).
  *
  * Kept separate from [[OnnxFeatures]] on purpose: that 7-feature set is the input contract of the currently deployed
  * model, so its shape must not change. `RichFeatures` reuses it for the material block and appends the positional
  * columns, giving a distinct input for a model trained on the richer set. Computing features here — in the engine, the
  * single source of truth for move generation — means training-data enrichment and inference share this exact code,
  * with no Python/Scala re-implementation drift.
  *
  * All features are from `color`'s own perspective (own minus opponent) and independent of the dice pool, matching the
  * dice-free leaf the search evaluates.
  *
  * @note
  *   Cost: `mobility_diff` runs two full [[MoveGenerator.generateAllMoves]] passes, so this set is **not** cheap enough
  *   to evaluate on every leaf of a 2-ply search (hundreds of thousands per move). It targets training enrichment and
  *   one-ply / shallow inference — the "one-ply + rich features vs. two-ply + material" comparison.
