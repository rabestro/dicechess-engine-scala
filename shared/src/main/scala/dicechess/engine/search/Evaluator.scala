    * probe that stopped at the first attacking piece type, so in practice it scaled a number that rarely exceeded one
    * or two. It now scales the true attacker count, which raises the term's weight relative to the pawn-storm and
    * proximity heuristics it was balanced against.
    *
    * Kept at 25 on evidence, not inertia. A sweep of 6/8/10/12/15/20/25 against the pre-#513 behaviour (2000 games
    * each) put every corrected weight at or above level, 50.6–51.9%, with a mild monotone preference for smaller
    * values; a direct A/B of w10 and w12 against w25 (3000 games) then measured only +0.9pp, inside the ±1.8pp the
    * sample can resolve. Re-scaling on that would be tuning to noise, so the correction ships alone. This is still the
    * knob to turn if the balance is revisited — with a run large enough to separate the candidates.
