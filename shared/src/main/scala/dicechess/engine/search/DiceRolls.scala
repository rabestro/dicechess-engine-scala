/** The probability distribution of a single Dice Chess roll (3d6), as the chance-node primitive shared by every
  * algorithm that has to integrate over an unknown roll.
  *
  * A turn rolls three six-sided dice. Order does not matter (the three pips are a multiset of piece types the mover
  * must play), so the 216 = 6³ ordered outcomes collapse into **56 distinct sorted multisets**, each carrying the
  * number of ordered rolls that map onto it as its weight:
  *
  * | Pattern | Example   | Weight | Count |
  * |:--------|:----------|-------:|------:|
  * | AAA     | `[1,1,1]` |      1 |     6 |
  * | AAB     | `[1,1,2]` |      3 |    30 |
  * | ABC     | `[1,2,3]` |      6 |    20 |
  *
  * Total: 6×1 + 30×3 + 20×6 = 216. The probability of a multiset is therefore `weight / 216`.
  *
  * This lives on its own (rather than inside a single consumer) because it is the exact distribution both
  * [[KingCaptureProbability]] and an expectimax chance node must sum over — the same 56 weighted outcomes, computed
  * once. Backed by an [[IArray]] so hot loops iterate it allocation-free.
