/** Canonical DFEN normalization, shared with the `dicechess-analytics` position store.
  *
  * The position dedup key (`normalized_fen` in analytics) and the opening-book key
  * ([[dicechess.engine.search.OpeningBook.key]]) are the first four DFEN fields. Raw [[FenParser.serialize]] writes an
  * en-passant target after *every* pawn double-push, even when no capture is possible. In Dice Chess a turn spans
  * several micro-moves, so the en-passant field at turn end is path-dependent: the same tactically-identical position
  * serializes under many en-passant variants (target set vs cleared), which fragments the position store and the
  * opening-book / equity samples.
  *
  * [[normalizedFen]] removes that ambiguity with the X-FEN convention: an en-passant target is kept only when the side
  * to move can actually capture it. Whether a capture exists is a move-generation property, so this lives next to
  * [[PawnGeneration]] rather than in the pure-domain [[FenParser]] (which must stay free of move-generation knowledge,
  * and whose `serialize`/`parse` round-trip must remain intact).
  *
  * The four-field result is, by contract, byte-for-byte the analytics `normalized_fen`. Any change here is a
  * cross-repository breaking change and must be mirrored in the analytics normalizer and its round-trip test.
