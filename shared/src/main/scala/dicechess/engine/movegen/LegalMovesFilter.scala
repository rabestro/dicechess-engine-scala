/** Legal moves filter for Dice Chess.
  *
  * Implements the **Maximum Micro-moves Rule**: a player must choose a first move that is part of the longest possible
  * sequence of micro-moves achievable with the rolled dice.
  *
  * ## Two types of legal first moves
  *   1. **King-Capture** — any sequence of micro-moves that *ends* with capturing the opponent's King is always legal,
  *      regardless of whether it is 1, 2, or 3 moves long.
  *   2. **Non-King-Capture** — any sequence of micro-moves that does *not* end with a King capture must achieve the
  *      globally optimal length `L*(state, dice)`.
  *
  * ## Rules encoded here
  *   - **Normal move** — consumes exactly one die of the matching piece type.
  *   - **Castling** — requires *and* consumes *both* the King die (`6`) and the Rook die (`4`) simultaneously.
  *   - **King-Capture** — terminates the game; a King capture contributes its depth to `maxLen` but is not recursed
  *     into (the game is over). All branches continue to be searched so that `maxLen` is computed correctly.
  *   - **Active-color invariance** — the active color is kept fixed for every intermediate state produced during a
  *     turn; it is *not* toggled between micro-moves.

    *
    * A King-Capture move terminates its branch at depth 1 (the game ends). However, the search continues exploring all
    * other branches — King captures do **not** short-circuit the entire computation. This ensures that `maxLen`
    * reflects the true global maximum, including paths of length 2 or 3 that exist alongside a 1-move King capture.

  /** Filters and returns the legal first moves for a given position and rolled dice.

    * A first move is legal if and only if one of the following holds:
    *   1. **King-Capture path** — there exists a continuation from this move (including the move itself) that captures
    *      the opponent's King, making it a win-condition sequence. Legal at any length (1, 2, or 3 micro-moves).
    *   2. **Maximum-length condition** — the move is part of a non-King-capture path whose total length equals
    *      `L*(state, dice)`, the globally optimal sequence length.
    *
    * When no moves are achievable at all (all rolled dice correspond to piece types absent from the board), an empty
